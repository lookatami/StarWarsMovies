Analyse first 6 movies of Star Wars. Which movies did user like the most and of what demographics

While waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens to come out, the team at FiveThirtyEight became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: "Does the rest of America realize that â€œThe Empire Strikes Back" is clearly the best movie out of first 6 movies?"

The team needed to collect data addressing this question. To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received 835 total responses

For this project, I cleaned and explored the dataset in Jupyter notebook.
